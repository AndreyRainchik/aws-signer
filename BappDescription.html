<p>Burp Extension for AWS Sigv4 Signing</p>

<p>Add your Access Key, Secret Key, Region, and Service to the properties in the extension tab.</p>

<p>The extension will look for the "X-AMZ-Date" header in all requests being sent by Burp. If it finds a request, it will update the signature in the request. Your request must also have an Authorization header, which should be on all AWS signed requests.</p>
